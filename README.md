Developed an interactive visualization tool to demonstrate shortest-path finding using Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm.

Implemented grid-based pathfinding with obstacles, start/end node selection, and real-time updates.

Built with JavaScript, HTML, CSS (or React, if you used it) to provide a dynamic and user-friendly interface.

Optimized algorithm execution to handle large grids efficiently and display step-by-step exploration.

Gained strong understanding of graph traversal, priority queues, and shortest path algorithms.
